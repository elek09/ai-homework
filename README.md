# StackOverflow Answer Stream Processor

This Python script connects to a server that streams answers submitted to StackOverflow, Data Science, and Cooking Stack Exchange sites. 
The program processes these answers in real-time and outputs the number of answers submitted to each site within a 5-second sliding window, updated every second.
